## ▶️ How to Run

```sh
ruby main.rb
```

## 🚀 Example Usage

```ruby
processor = InvoiceProcessor.new(
  OpenStruct.new(name: "Ahmed", country: "EG", email: "ahmed@mail.com"),
  [
    { price: 10, quantity: 2 },
    { price: 30, quantity: 1 }
  ],
  VisaPayment.new,
  FileLogger.new,
  EmailNotifier.new
)

processor.process
```

### Expected Output:

When you run the processor, you should see messages like the following in your terminal:

```sh
Paid using VISA
Email sent to ahmed@mail.com: thanks for your purchase
```

Note:

The invoice is also logged in invoice_log.txt with content like:
User: Ahmed, Total: 57.0
